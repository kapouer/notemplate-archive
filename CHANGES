Version 0.1.0
=============

* mangler option rewritten. Data is fetched *after* mangler is called.
  The callback given to mangler(uri, cb) has cb.request that buffers
  data.
  Properties of returned mangled object are now uri, path, href, data.
  uri is the where to fetch the data (optional if data is present),
  href is what attribute to set the dom node to.

Version 0.0.7
=============

* fix match option not calling callback.

Version 0.0.6
=============

* add option match (defaults to /.*/) to let us specify which files must
  be processed (downloaded and mangled).

Version 0.0.5
=============

* returned mangled objects can have a new property : "href", which is used
  to change the DOM attribute only, not the path. Used in automated
  deployments of tarballs.

Version 0.0.4
=============

* mangler(href, data, cb) where cb(result)
  and result can be falsey, string, object with path and/or data keys,
  array of such objects (the first object being the one given to mangler).
  When an array, each new path, data pair creates a new tar file entry.

Version 0.0.3
=============

* Use default mangler if options.mangler returns falsey value.

Version 0.0.2
=============

* options.mangler can replace the default mangler which replaces uri by
  its pathname (without leading slash).

Version 0.0.1
=============

* initial version
