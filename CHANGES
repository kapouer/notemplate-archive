Version 0.3.0
=============

* depends on express-notemplate 0.3.0, use window.XMLHttpRequest to
  make the downloads, benefiting from current environment (Cookie...)

Version 0.2.3
=============

* fix tarring of a single html file (there was some race condition)

Version 0.2.2
=============

* fix bug introduced in previous version (stream undefined)

Version 0.2.1
=============

* the default tar stream can be replaced by the archiveStream option

Version 0.2.0
=============

* add xhr resources to the tarball
* setup using require('notemplate-archive')(notemplate);
* breaking change: use window.location.pathname to determine the name
  of the html file and default root path.

Version 0.1.3
=============

* remove superagent dependency, plain http client is already in use
* fix truncated index.html due to wrong length given to tar

Version 0.1.2
=============

* fix finish() called too soon when removing a DOM node
* small style fixes.

Version 0.1.1
=============

* if uri, href, path are empty on first returned object,
  or if the object is null, remove the DOM node.
* allow returning empty uri - data won't be fetched.

Version 0.1.0
=============

* mangler option rewritten. Data is fetched *after* mangler is called.
  The callback given to mangler(uri, cb) has cb.request that buffers
  data.
  Properties of returned mangled object are now uri, path, href, data.
  uri is the where to fetch the data (optional if data is present),
  href is what attribute to set the dom node to.

Version 0.0.7
=============

* fix match option not calling callback.

Version 0.0.6
=============

* add option match (defaults to /.*/) to let us specify which files must
  be processed (downloaded and mangled).

Version 0.0.5
=============

* returned mangled objects can have a new property : "href", which is used
  to change the DOM attribute only, not the path. Used in automated
  deployments of tarballs.

Version 0.0.4
=============

* mangler(href, data, cb) where cb(result)
  and result can be falsey, string, object with path and/or data keys,
  array of such objects (the first object being the one given to mangler).
  When an array, each new path, data pair creates a new tar file entry.

Version 0.0.3
=============

* Use default mangler if options.mangler returns falsey value.

Version 0.0.2
=============

* options.mangler can replace the default mangler which replaces uri by
  its pathname (without leading slash).

Version 0.0.1
=============

* initial version
